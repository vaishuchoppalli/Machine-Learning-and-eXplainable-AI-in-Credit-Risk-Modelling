## Abstract

Machine Learning and AI have become a torch-bearing technology in the world, especially in the Financial Sector. It can bring new opportunities to bring about customer experience and significantly improve risk management. Though it is simple to run state-of-the-art ML models, making new models that could be implemented in the real world have always been challenging. This could be attributed to the fact that Machine Learning models have less transparency and explainability which are both key factors in developing reliable technologies. Within this paper we concentrate on applications of machine learning and using an advanced post hoc model explainability technique called SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) in credit risk management. We implement the XGBoost machine learning model on the open-access dataset offered by the Lending Club - a US based Peer-to-peer lending platform. We also discuss in detail the graphs generated using SHAP values.
